This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in COBOL programs related to date and time validation. The `bug.cob` file contains a program that attempts to validate user-inputted dates and times. However, the validation logic uses simple string comparisons, which can lead to incorrect results if input format is not strictly adhered to.  The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version using more robust date/time handling.
